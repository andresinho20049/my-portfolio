#   # Finished step build
#   This can be added to the test pipeline in the build process.    
#   
#   ## About
#   To ensure a successful build, it's crucial to differentiate between the building and execution stages. 
#   The Runner plays a pivotal role in this distinction, as it dictates how the entire process should be executed. 
#   During the building phase, it's highly recommended to conduct thorough testing to identify and eliminate any potential errors. 
#   For the build to be executed seamlessly, it should be conducted in a temporary environment on Docker. 
#   
#   ## Example
#   Defines the target in the build command.
#   - development  
#   `docker build -t portifolio_dev:0.0.1v --target development .`
#   
#   - builder   
#   `docker build -t portifolio_pkg:0.0.1v --target builder .`
#   
#   - production    
#   (The last clause of "from" to default target .)
#   `docker build -t portifolio:0.0.1v .`
