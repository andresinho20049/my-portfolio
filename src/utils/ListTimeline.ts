     - User can record an audio and through API's Speech-to-text the audio is transcribed, after the text is returned with speech, the VLibras service is called, performing the translation into Libras.
     - By changing the mode to text, the user can type and the typed text will be translated into pounds.

    Note: At the time of submission of the TCC, the STT API belonged to GCP services, however recently a free API has been used and the operation in the voice function presents problems in very long speeches.

    The application was designed with simplicity and increased accessibility in mind. Many Brazilians with hearing impairment need the help of an interpreter to communicate effectively. Therefore, when observing a classmate who was accompanied by an interpreter in class, and remembering that few have the monetary resources to do the same, the idea proposed in this monograph was conceived. Therefore, the application's main objective is to help deaf people who need to communicate and carry out daily tasks, but who cannot have the help of an interpreter, even momentarily.`,
