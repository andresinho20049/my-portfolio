Excel spreadsheet with userForm and macros developed with VBA for management and control.

These forms have a complete crud, PDF report generation, financial planning and much more.

It is possible for the user to select expenses by adding them to a listview, then export a customized PDF report with the selected items.

For example:
  - Alert when employee is close to experience
  - Alert when due date and/or receipt is close to date
  - Generate report with planning based on data selected in listview
  - Model PDF is based on Sheet template

<ins
  className="adsbygoogle"
  style={{ display: "block", textAlign: "center" }}
  data-ad-layout="in-article"
  data-ad-format="fluid"
  data-ad-client="ca-pub-3617432012620885"
  data-ad-slot="6978263277"
></ins>

```VBA
Sub report_PDF()

    Plan6.Activate
    
    ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:=ActiveWorkbook.Path _
    & "\Report " & Format(Now, "dd-mm-yy hh-MM-ss") & ".pdf", Quality:= _
    xlQualityStandard, IncludeDocProperties:=False, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:=True

End Sub
```
