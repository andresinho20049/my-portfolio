## About

### What's Our Mission
Our mission is to bring a tool that enthusiasts, students and researchers can use to assist in searches and research with EMIT.

The EMIT offers a diverse range of active applications that span beyond greenhouse gas mapping, snow properties, and water resources. Its potential could extend to natural hazards, environmental pollution, coastal waters, harmful algal blooms, agricultural monitoring, forest management and fire, vegetation community, and biodiversity monitoring. With the ability to support a wide array of environmental monitoring and management efforts, EMIT is a valuable tool for businesses and academics alike.

### The EMIT
The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth’s arid dust source regions. The measurements will then be used as input data for the composition of dust sources in Earth System Models (ESM). EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take mineralogical measurements of sunlit regions of interest between 52° N latitude and 52° S latitude. Up to five visits (three on average) of each arid target region are scheduled, only downlinking acquisitions that are not dominated by cloud cover. The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer that uses contiguous spectroscopic measurements in the visible to shortwave infrared region of the spectrum to resolve absorption features of dust-forming minerals. EMIT has a viewing swath width of 75 km, measuring 285 bands at a spatial resolution of 60 m. Maps of the relative abundance of source minerals that are generated from EMIT data will advance our understanding of the current and future impacts of mineral dust in the Earth system.

## EMIT for the Future!
Since its July 14, 2022 launch to the space station, the EMIT hyperspectral visible/short-wave infrared sensor has been extremely useful!

### EMIT has the potential to revolutionize this field of remote sensing

EMIT incorporates multiple advanced new technologies. Its Dyson spectrometer optical layout provides exceptionally high photon throughput, meaning the optics maximize the light reaching the detector. The detector array uses new custom coatings to maximize sensitivity over the full EMIT wavelength range. Across EMIT’s 39-mile (72-kilometer) field of view, the instrument has a uniform spectral response. This allows use of the most advanced data processing algorithms.

### Applications
EMIT offers a diverse range of active applications that go beyond mapping greenhouse gases, snow properties and water resources. Its potential could extend to natural hazards, environmental pollution, coastal waters, harmful algal blooms, agricultural monitoring, forest and fire management, plant community and biodiversity monitoring. With the ability to support a wide range of environmental monitoring and management efforts, EMIT is a valuable tool for businesses and academics alike.

#### Active Applications

##### Greenhouse gas mapping
Methane and carbon dioxide have distinct absorption features in the shortwave infrared (1800-2500nm) that permit the detection and mapping of point source greenhouse gas emissions with EMIT data.

##### Snow properties and water resources
 Despite this crucial role of the brightness (albedo) of snow, sparse measurements have kept us from understanding the global distribution of controls on snow albedo, grain size and radiative forcing by light-absorbing particles. In turn, this void has prevented us from accurately modeling cryosphere processes worldwide.
 > The accuracies required to understand the relative roles of changes in albedo and GHG radiative forcing in changing snow warming and melt require the spectral resolving capacity of the VSWIR imaging spectrometer.

#### Potential Applications

**Natural Hazards**
EMIT data could enable detection of a variety of natural hazards and could be used to guide disaster management strategies.

##### Environmental pollution
Spectrometers like EMIT have been used to map oil extent from the deep water horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, plastics in the environment, and to accelerate clean up of an acid mine superfund site in Leadville, CO.

##### Coastal waters and harmful algal blooms
 The EMIT sensor can be used to monitor ocean phytoplankton, harmful algal bloom biomass and composition, coral presence and bleaching events, and the health of coastal ecosystems.

##### Agricultural monitoring
Crop health and agricultural production is essential to maintaining human health and societies. EMIT will collect data over many of the world's agricultural regions. Depending on the season and crop management, these data can provide information on crop types, vegetation health and disease, crop residue composition, and soil mineralogy.

##### Forest management & fire
Forest lands both in the western US and across the globe are at increasingly high risk of mortality from drought, beetle outbreaks, and wildfire. Data from EMIT could be used to monitor forest health through the water content of canopies, composition and dry biomass that make up fire fuels, and low risk areas where vegetation is absent, creating a nuanced perspective of fire risk across forest landscapes.

##### Vegetation community and biodiversity monitoring
Understanding the locations, distributions, and diversity of vegetation communities helps to promote good management and conservation efforts. EMIT data provide an opportunity to establish baseline maps of vegetation communities around the globe to help monitor ecosystem health, biodiversity loss, and conservation efforts. These maps could also be used to map the habitat of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, to assist public health efforts to contain vector borne diseases.

### Data analysis
Let's work the data from the tables into a unified data frame. By representing coordinates in the (n, 2) structure, we can leverage numpy to perform the necessary statistical analysis. Our objective is to map the methane plume and authenticate its temporal and spatial characteristics. We will later feed the data into a machine learning algorithm to generate predictions based on the available information.

### How we study the data
Identifying mineral dust, methane plumes, and carbon gas poses a formidable challenge when dealing with cutting-edge instrumentation. 

However, the EMIT team provided us with numerous tools, rendering our work a more enjoyable experience. By utilizing the `Collaboratory` platform and models available in the GIT repository, we were able to effectively analyze the data. Additionally, we registered with NASA Earthdata to download and access S3, allowing us to search and work with the data.

Our work became increasingly complex when we encountered files with the extensions `.tif` and `.nc`, which were gigabytes in size. To properly analyze the data, we employed libraries such as `holoviews`, `array`, `netCDF4`, and `gdal`. 

Furthermore, we relied on commonly used libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, which provided assistance.

### NextJs and App router
In version 13, Next.js introduced a new App Router built on React Server Components, which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

The App Router works in a new directory named app. The app directory works alongside the pages directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the pages directory for previous behavior. If your application uses the pages directory, please also see the Pages Router documentation.

[see more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#:~:text=In%20version%2013,Pages%20Router%20documentation.)

### MDX
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML. It's commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs.

MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.

Next.js can support both local MDX content inside your application, as well as remote MDX files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).

### Why we use MDX
Our goal was to establish a platform that allows users to generate and share their EMIT articles in a centralized location.

To achieve this, our solution has a folder structure that automatically loads MDX files onto the website as new pages.

Thanks to this recently introduced technology, we were able to meet our requirements and unite our approach.
